[![Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/johnnyreilly/proverb-react-mobx?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/JohnReilly/proverb-react-mobx) [![TypeScript definitions on DefinitelyTyped](http://definitelytyped.org/badges/standard-flat.svg)](http://definitelytyped.org)

Proverb is a simple app that stores the wise sayings of sages.  Most notably those of "Socrates" Aruldas.

This repository is built using the following technologies:

- TypeScript using ES-latest
- React
- Webpack (with ts-loader for TypeScript compilation and babel-loader for transpilation)
- Karma for testing

This is the React front end of Proverb.
